# mirror
A code mirror based on program slicing.

# mark
Analysis the project, extract packages, classes, methods, variables from it and then construct control-dependence-graph and store it using neo4j-ogm.

# next
The neo4j cypher will be used to perform program slicing algorithms in the next step.
